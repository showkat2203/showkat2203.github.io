# chy.io

Personal site for Md Showkat Hossain Chy. Astro, TypeScript, static output, no
client framework. Deployed to GitHub Pages at [chy.io](https://chy.io).

## Editing content

All content lives in `src/content/` as YAML. Components read it through typed
collections, so adding a publication or a role means editing one file and
nothing else. The schemas are in `src/content.config.ts`; a build fails loudly
if a required field is missing or misspelled.

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `profile.yaml` | Name, email, links, hero sentence, publication record |
| `domains.yaml` | The three bands on the magnitude rail |
| `work.yaml` | Selected work entries, each with its position on the rail |
| `experience.yaml` | Roles, with exact `start`/`end` dates and CV bullets |
| `publications.yaml` | All publications, newest first |
| `skills.yaml` | Technical range, grouped by magnitude band |
| `cv.yaml` | Education, service, teaching, background, languages |

To add a publication, copy any block in `publications.yaml`. Set
`headlineOrder` to 1–5 to surface it on the home page, or `null` to leave it on
`/publications` only. Fill `doi` or `url` and the entry links itself; while both
are `null` it renders a visible "link pending" note rather than a dead link. The
link text names the publisher, derived from the DOI's registrant prefix in
`src/components/Citation.astro` — add a prefix there if a new one appears.

Author names print exactly as written. Any name matching
`profile.selfAliases` is bolded automatically.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4321
```

```bash
npm run build        # static output in dist/
npm run preview      # serve the built site
```

## Deploying

Push to `main`. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds the site and publishes it
to GitHub Pages.

```bash
git push origin main
```

One-time setup in the repository settings: set **Pages → Build and deployment →
Source** to **GitHub Actions**, and point `chy.io`'s DNS at GitHub Pages.
`public/CNAME` already claims the domain, and GitHub redirects
`showkat2203.github.io` to it.

For Netlify or Vercel instead: build command `npm run build`, publish
directory `dist`, no other configuration.

## Regenerating the CV PDF and the social card

Both are committed to `public/` and are only rebuilt when their source changes.
They need a Chromium — `npx playwright install chromium`, or set `CHROME_PATH`.

```bash
npm run build
npm run cv:pdf       # renders /cv through its print styles to public/cv.pdf
npm run og           # redraws public/og.png from the design tokens
```

The PDF is generated from the `/cv` page itself, so the two cannot drift apart.

## Checks

```bash
npm run audit        # typecheck, build, axe, behaviour, Lighthouse
```

Individually: `npm run check` (types), `npm run a11y` (axe-core on every route
at 1280px and 360px), `npm run verify` (no horizontal scroll from 320px,
keyboard focus, the publications filter, copy-to-clipboard, reduced motion,
and the no-JavaScript fallback), `npm run lighthouse`.

Last run: Lighthouse performance 99–100, accessibility 100, best practices 100,
SEO 100 across all three routes; zero axe violations; 23 of 23 behaviour checks
passing.

`npm run shots` writes screenshots to `.shots/` for design review.

## Still to fill in

Search the content files for `PLACEHOLDER`:

- LinkedIn URL in `profile.yaml`.
- One link in `publications.yaml`: `segah-2023-bless` has no DOI or stable
  publisher page indexed, so it still renders "link pending".

Four entries in `publications.yaml` carry a `VERIFY` comment where the
publisher's record disagrees with the CV the content came from — the venue on
the ASE paper, the published title on the Cluster Computing paper, the author
list on the JSS paper, and the year and pages on the CCIS chapter. The CV's
wording was kept in each case; the DOIs resolve regardless.

`PROFILE-README.md` in this repo is the rewritten GitHub profile README; it
belongs in the `showkat2203/showkat2203` repository, not this one.
